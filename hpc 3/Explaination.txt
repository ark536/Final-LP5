Includes:
The code includes <iostream> for standard input-output operations and <omp.h> for OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) operations.
It also includes <climits> to use predefined constants for minimum and maximum integer values.
Function definitions:
min_reduction: This function finds the minimum value in an array using OpenMP parallelization with a reduction clause.
max_reduction: This function finds the maximum value in an array using OpenMP parallelization with a reduction clause.
sum_reduction: This function calculates the sum of all elements in an array using OpenMP parallelization with a reduction clause.
average_reduction: This function calculates the average of all elements in an array using OpenMP parallelization with a reduction clause. Note: There's a mistake in this function where it divides by (n-1) instead of n, which would lead to incorrect average calculation.
main() function:
It starts by prompting the user to enter the total number of elements.
Dynamically allocates memory for an array of integers based on the user input.
Prompts the user to enter the elements of the array.
Calls the four reduction functions (min_reduction, max_reduction, sum_reduction, and average_reduction) passing the array and its size.
The program ends after printing the minimum, maximum, sum, and average values of the array.
Overall, this code demonstrates how to perform reduction operations (finding minimum, maximum, sum, and average) on an array using OpenMP parallelization techniques, which can improve performance by utilizing multiple threads.
