Sure, let's break down the code step by step:

Includes and defines:
The code includes necessary headers like <iostream> and <bits/stdc++.h> for standard input-output operations and random number generation respectively.
It also includes <cuda.h> for CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) operations.
The BLOCK_SIZE is defined as 16.
Function definitions:
fill_array: This function populates an array with random numbers between 0 and 99.
add_cpu: This function performs element-wise addition of two arrays on the CPU.
print_matrix: This function prints the elements of an array.
Kernel function:
__global__ void add: This is a CUDA kernel function responsible for performing element-wise addition of two arrays on the GPU. Each thread calculates one element of the result array.
main() function:
It starts by prompting the user to enter the size of the arrays.
Dynamically allocates memory for three arrays: arr1_cpu, arr2_cpu, and result_cpu.
Populates arr1_cpu and arr2_cpu with random numbers.
Dynamically allocates memory for three GPU arrays: arr1_gpu, arr2_gpu, and result_gpu using cudaMallocManaged(). This memory allocation allows for Unified Memory, which simplifies memory management between the CPU and GPU.
Copies data from CPU arrays to GPU arrays using cudaMemcpy().
Creates CUDA events start and stop for measuring GPU execution time.
Defines CUDA grid and block dimensions. Grid and block dimensions determine how CUDA threads are organized.
Records the start event.
Launches the CUDA kernel function add with specified grid and block dimensions.
Records the stop event.
Calculates the elapsed time using CUDA events.
Copies the result from the GPU to the CPU using cudaMemcpy().
Prints the GPU result and its execution time.
Frees memory allocated on the GPU using cudaFree().
Repeats the process for CPU addition, measuring its execution time.
The program ends by returning 0.
Overall, this code demonstrates how to perform vector addition using both CPU and GPU, and measures the execution time for comparison.
